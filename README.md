# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Application

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that utilizes a Q&A system based on a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents and generate meaningful answers. The system leverages data scraped from websites and APIs to create a custom **embeddings database**. This database is then used to compare user queries with the document content to find the most relevant responses.

### Key Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Data is scraped from websites using **BeautifulSoup** to gather content for the embeddings database.
- **Embeddings Database**: Uses embeddings to create vectorized representations of the document content.
- **Q&A System**: A simple question-answering system that measures the similarity between the user's query and the scraped content to generate relevant responses.
- **APIs Integration**: Some of the scraped data is gathered through APIs, offering an additional source of information for the Q&A system.

## Technologies Used
- **BeautifulSoup:** For web scraping to collect content for the embeddings database.
- **APIs:** For gathering data from external sources.
- **Embedding Models:** Such as Gemini's embeddings or other suitable models for generating document vector representations.
- **Similarity Metrics:** Used to measure the similarity between the user's question and the documents in the database.
- **Python:** The main programming language used in this project.

## How It Works
- **Data Collection:** The project scrapes data from websites using BeautifulSoup and collects information through various APIs.
- **Embeddings Creation:** Once the data is gathered, it is processed into embeddingsâ€”vector representations of the text content. These embeddings are stored in a database for efficient retrieval.
- **Q&A System:** The user inputs a question, and the system uses similarity metrics to compare the question against the embeddings in the database. The most relevant documents are retrieved, and the system generates an answer based on the retrieved content.
- **Result Generation:** The system generates a relevant answer by referencing the retrieved documents and combining the most appropriate information.
